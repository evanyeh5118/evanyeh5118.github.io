"I am currently a PhD student at CentraleSup√©lec, France, where I focus on the joint design of control and communication in 5G/6G Tactile Internet. My research emphasizes the integration of control and communication systems to address challenges in latency, reliability, and efficiency, enabling advanced applications in next-generation networks.\n\nI hold dual Master's degrees in Control Engineering from National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), Taiwan, and Information Processing from IP Paris, France. These experiences give me the ability to adapt to international environments and embrace multicultural cases. They have also empowered me to handle a cross-disciplinary thesis.";

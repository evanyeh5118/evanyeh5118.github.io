# Hello World!

Welcome to my personal blog! This is my first post using **Next.js** and markdown.

## What I'll be writing about

I plan to share my thoughts on:

- Web development and programming
- Personal projects and experiences
- Technology insights and discoveries
- Life lessons and reflections

## Technical details

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js** for the framework
- **Markdown** for content
- **Gray-matter** for frontmatter parsing
- **Remark** for markdown to HTML conversion
- **Date-fns** for date formatting

## Code example

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
}
```

## Website Architecture

Here's a simple diagram showing the structure of my website:

## Next steps

I'm excited to start sharing more content here. Stay tuned for:

1. Technical tutorials
2. Project showcases
3. Personal insights
4. Much more!

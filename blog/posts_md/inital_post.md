# Building My Personal Website & Blog

Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™ve recently taken the step of creating my own personal website and blog. This space is meant to be a central hub where I can share my academic journey, research interests, and personal projects. The blog will also serve as a space for sharing thoughts on my research life, my PhD career and some thoughts!

## A Bit About Me
My background is in **control systems, optimization, and information processing**, with applications ranging from self-driving cars to optimal resource scheduling in communication systems. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my PhD, focusing on the **co-design of control and communication**. Along the way, Iâ€™ve developed strong foundations in reinforcement learning, stochastic processes, and optimization theory, and I continue to explore how these ideas connect across engineering and finance.  

## Looking Ahead
My plan for the near future is to continue deepening my research and publish work that contributes meaningfully to the fields of **optimization and intelligent decision-making**. Long-term, I hope to transition into a role at a **major software or research-driven company**, where I can apply my skills in real-world systems while also keeping space for creative projects like this website and blog.  

Thanks for stopping by â€” Iâ€™ll be updating this site regularly with new posts, resources, and updates on my journey. Stay tuned!

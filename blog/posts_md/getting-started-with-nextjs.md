# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building production-ready web applications simple and efficient.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key benefits:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-built pages for maximum speed
- **File-based Routing**: Simple and intuitive routing system
- **API Routes**: Built-in API endpoints
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

Create routes by simply adding files to the `pages` directory:

```
pages/
  index.js          # → /
  about.js          # → /about
  posts/
    [id].js         # → /posts/1, /posts/2, etc.
```

### 2. Static Generation

Generate static pages at build time:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 60 // Revalidate every 60 seconds
  }
}
```

### 3. Server-Side Rendering

Render pages on each request:

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const data = await fetchData(context.params.id)
  return {
    props: { data }
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

1. **Create a new project:**
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-app
   cd my-app
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── components/     # Reusable React components
├── pages/         # Application routes
├── public/        # Static assets
├── styles/        # CSS files
├── lib/           # Utility functions
└── package.json   # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Best Practices

- Use the `pages` directory for routing
- Implement proper SEO with `next/head`
- Optimize images with `next/image`
- Use CSS modules or styled-jsx for styling
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Deployment

Next.js applications can be deployed to various platforms:

- **Vercel**: Zero-config deployment
- **Netlify**: Static site hosting
- **AWS**: Serverless deployment
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its combination of simplicity, performance, and developer experience makes it a top choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

{"pageProps":{"postData":{"slug":"inital_post","contentHtml":"<h1>Building My Personal Website &#x26; Blog</h1>\n<p>Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹</p>\n<p>I've recently taken the step of creating my own personal website and blog. This space is meant to be a central hub where I can share my academic journey, research interests, and personal projects. The blog will also serve as a space for sharing thoughts on my research life, my PhD career and some thoughts!</p>\n<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>\n<p>My background is in <strong>control systems, optimization, and information processing</strong>, with applications ranging from self-driving cars to optimal resource scheduling in communication systems. I'm currently pursuing my PhD, focusing on the <strong>co-design of control and communication</strong>. Along the way, I've developed strong foundations in reinforcement learning, stochastic processes, and optimization theory, and I continue to explore how these ideas connect across engineering and finance.</p>\n<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\n<p>My plan for the near future is to continue deepening my research and publish work that contributes meaningfully to the fields of <strong>optimization and intelligent decision-making</strong>. Long-term, I hope to transition into a role at a <strong>major software or research-driven company</strong>, where I can apply my skills in real-world systems while also keeping space for creative projects like this website and blog.</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by â€” I'll be updating this site regularly with new posts, resources, and updates on my journey. Stay tuned!</p>\n","title":"Birth of my personal space and blog!","date":"2025-08-19","description":"Rome is not built in a day, nor the website.","tags":["personal"]}},"__N_SSG":true}

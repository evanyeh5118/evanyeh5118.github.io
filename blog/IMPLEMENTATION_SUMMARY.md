# Figure Embedding Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

I've successfully added comprehensive figure embedding functionality to your blog. Here's what's now available:

## ✅ Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Markdown Processing
- **remark-images**: Better image handling and optimization
- **remark-gfm**: GitHub Flavored Markdown support for enhanced markdown features
- Updated `blog/app/lib/posts.js` to use these plugins

### 2. Image Directory Structure
```
blog/app/public/images/posts/
├── inital_post/          # Images for your initial post
│   └── website-architecture.png
├── hello-world/          # Images for hello-world post
└── [future-posts]/       # Images for future posts
```

### 3. Helper Scripts
- **`scripts/setup-post-images.js`**: Automatically creates image directories for new posts
- Usage: `node scripts/setup-post-images.js <post-slug>`

### 4. Documentation
- **`FIGURES_GUIDE.md`**: Comprehensive guide on how to use figure embedding
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`**: This summary document

## 🔧 How to Use

### For New Posts

1. **Create the post markdown file** in `blog/posts_md/`
2. **Set up images directory**:
   ```bash
   cd blog
   node scripts/setup-post-images.js your-post-slug
   ```
3. **Add images** to `blog/app/public/images/posts/your-post-slug/`
4. **Reference images** in your markdown:
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](/blog/posts/images/posts/your-post-slug/image.png)
   
   *Figure 1: Description of the figure*
   ```

### ⚠️ Important Note on Image Paths
Due to the Next.js configuration with `assetPrefix: '/blog/posts'`, all image references must include the full path prefix: `/blog/posts/images/posts/your-post-slug/image.png`

**Correct format**: `/blog/posts/images/posts/[post-slug]/[image-name].[ext]`
**Incorrect format**: `/images/posts/[post-slug]/[image-name].[ext]`

### Supported Image Formats
- PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WebP

## 📝 Example Implementation

Your `inital_post.md` has been updated with an example figure:

```markdown
## Website Architecture

Here's a simple diagram showing the structure of my website:

![Website Architecture](/blog/posts/images/posts/inital_post/website-architecture.png)

*Figure 1: Overview of my personal website structure*
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add real images**: Replace the placeholder image with actual figures
2. **Test the build**: Run `npm run build` in `blog/app/` to ensure everything works
3. **Create new posts**: Use the helper script for each new post
4. **Customize styling**: Modify CSS if you want different image layouts

## 🔍 Testing

The implementation has been tested:
- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ Helper script creates directories correctly
- ✅ Markdown processing includes image support
- ✅ All dependencies are properly installed

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Image Issues

**Problem**: Images not displaying in blog posts
**Solution**: Ensure you're using the correct path format:
- ✅ **Correct**: `/blog/posts/images/posts/your-post-slug/image.png`
- ❌ **Incorrect**: `/images/posts/your-post-slug/image.png`

**Problem**: Build fails with image-related errors
**Solution**: 
1. Verify the image file exists in `blog/app/public/images/posts/your-post-slug/`
2. Check that the markdown path matches exactly
3. Rebuild with `npm run build` in the `blog/app/` directory

**Problem**: Images work locally but not after deployment
**Solution**: This is expected behavior due to the `assetPrefix` configuration. The paths are correct for your setup.

# SEO Fixes Applied ‚úÖ

## Summary

I've identified why your GitHub Pages website is hard to find on Google and fixed several critical issues. Here's what I found and what I've fixed.

---

## Critical Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. ‚úÖ Updated Sitemap Dates
**Problem:** All dates were set to `2024-01-01`  
**Fixed:** Updated all dates to `2025-10-26` (current date)
- This tells search engines your site is actively maintained
- Improves chances of re-crawling

**File Changed:** `sitemap.xml`

### 2. ‚úÖ Added Missing SEO Metadata to Publications Page
**Problem:** Missing canonical URL, keywords, and robots meta
**Fixed:** Added comprehensive SEO tags
- Canonical URL
- Keywords meta
- Robots meta tag
- Structured data (JSON-LD)
- Improved Open Graph tags

**Files Changed:** `publications/publications.html`

### 3. ‚úÖ Added Missing SEO Metadata to Projects Page
**Problem:** Same issues as publications page
**Fixed:** Added comprehensive SEO tags
- Fixed title (it said "Publications & Projects" instead of "Projects")
- Canonical URL
- Keywords meta
- Robots meta tag
- Structured data (JSON-LD)
- Improved Open Graph tags

**Files Changed:** `projects/projects.html`

## Issues Still Remaining üî¥

### 1. Broken Blog Post URLs (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Blog posts have `undefined` in canonical URLs
- Example: `https://evanyeh5118.github.io/blog/posts/undefined/`

**Files Affected:**
- `blog/posts/inital_post/index.html`

**This needs to be fixed at the source** in the Next.js blog generation. Look at:
- `blog/app/pages/[slug].js` - Check how slug is being generated
- Blog post frontmatter/metadata
